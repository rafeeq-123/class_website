            <td>Spanish culture lures visitors just as much as the tourist attractions themselves. Spain is famous for its tradition of siesta, an afternoon break during which workers and students take a few hours to eat, sleep and relax. This easygoing lifestyle permeates most of Spain.</td>
            <td>Spain's gastronomy varies from region to region. One of its best-known dishes is paella, a seafood and rice combination that originated along the Mediterranean Sea. You'll also find chorizo sausage links dangling behind the counters of most bars, restaurants and shops. </td>
            <td>Spain is on the same seasonal calendar as the United States and Great Britain, and weather varies greatly, depending on what part of the country you are visiting. Spring and fall generally bring in a higher volume of tourist traffic due to the more moderate climate during these months.</td>
